## Events for Adults

Without going into specifics about what defines an "Adult", we typically regard 21+ events as those meant for adults above 21 years of age or older. 

What happens at a 21+ event? There's a good chance alcohol will be involved. We are not lawyers or legal counsel, so we'll add the information below:

> As of this writing, the minimum legal age to purchase alcohol is 21 in all states within the United States. Furnishing alcohol to one's own children is permitted in 31 states, while it's _illegal_ to do so for other people's children in all fifty states.
